# RestrictionMappingFromMultiset-Akwb
This program searches for a enzyme-restriction map to a multiset using a recursive approach. It reads in a multiset from a file, establishes a beginning of solution, and then calls the search() function to find the result.

The search() function is a recursive function that examines each element in the multiset to determine if it can be added to the solution. If a solution is found, it is returned to the main function for output.

The program uses several helper functions to validate potential solutions, establish a beginning of the solution, and output results.
